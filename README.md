#Fake news detection
# Fake News Detection using NLP and Deep Learning

## Overview

This project aims to detect fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning techniques. We leverage text analysis, feature extraction, and machine learning models to classify news articles as either fake or real.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash  
    git clone <repository_url>  
    cd fake-news-detection  
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

bash
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS  
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows  
Install the required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Data
The dataset used for this project should contain labeled news articles, with columns for the article text and a binary label indicating whether the news is fake or real (e.g., 0 for real, 1 for fake). Example datasets include:

Kaggle Fake News Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data
LIAR Dataset: https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip
Place the dataset file (e.g., train.csv) in the data/ directory.

Features
We extract various features from the text of the news articles using NLP techniques:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Converts text into numerical representations reflecting the importance of words in the document.
Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText): Represents words as vectors in a high-dimensional space, capturing semantic relationships between words.
N-grams: Sequences of n words used to capture contextual information.
Sentiment Analysis: Scores indicating the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the text.
Stylometric Features: Features related to writing style, such as sentence length, word length, and vocabulary richness.
Models
We implement and evaluate several machine learning and deep learning models:

Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A powerful classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (e.g., LSTM, GRU): Neural networks designed for sequential data, capable of capturing long-range dependencies in text.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Neural networks that use convolutional layers to extract features from text.
Transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa): State-of-the-art pre-trained language models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.
Usage
Data Preparation:

Place your dataset in the data/ directory.
Modify the data loading and preprocessing steps in src/data_preprocessing.py to match your dataset format.
Feature Extraction:

Run the feature extraction scripts in src/feature_extraction/ to generate the desired features.
Example:
bash
python src/feature_extraction/tfidf_extraction.py  
Model Training:

Run the model training scripts in src/models/ to train and evaluate the models.
Example:
bash
python src/models/logistic_regression.py  
Evaluation:

Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Analyze the results and compare the performance of different models.
Results
Summarize the performance of different models on the test dataset. Include a table or a brief description of the key findings. For example:

Table
Model	              Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Logistic Regression	0.85	    0.82	    0.88	  0.85
LSTM              	0.90	    0.89	    0.91	  0.90
BERT	              0.95	    0.94	    0.96	  0.95
