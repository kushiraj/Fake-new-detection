# üì∞ Fake News Detection using NLP and Machine Learning

Welcome to the Fake News Detection project, a Python-based machine learning application that detects whether a news article is **real** or **fake**. This project uses traditional NLP techniques such as text cleaning, TF-IDF vectorization, and classic classifiers like **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, and **SVM**. It‚Äôs a great learning project for those exploring fake news analysis using interpretable machine learning models.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To set up the Fake News Detection project:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed. Then install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
üöÄ Usage
You can run the notebook or script depending on your use case:

Using Jupyter Notebook
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook FakeNewsDetection.ipynb
Using Python Script
bash
Copy
Edit
python predict.py --text "Enter a news article to check if it's real or fake."
Optional: Launch Web App (Streamlit)
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
üîç How It Works
This project uses classical NLP and ML for text classification.

Text Preprocessing
Removes punctuation, digits, and extra whitespace.

Converts all text to lowercase.

Removes stopwords using nltk.

Applies lemmatization to normalize words.

Feature Engineering
Uses TF-IDF Vectorizer and CountVectorizer to convert text into numerical form.

Applies dimensionality reduction if needed.

Model Training
Splits data into training and test sets.

Trains classifiers:

Logistic Regression

Multinomial Naive Bayes

SVM

Saves the best model using joblib or pickle.

Prediction & Evaluation
Loads the saved model.

Predicts input news as Real or Fake.

Evaluates with:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

üßæ Dataset
The project uses the Fake and Real News Dataset from Kaggle.

üìÅ Files:

True.csv: Real news articles

Fake.csv: Fake news articles

üìä Columns:

Title

Text

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.6 or above. Then install the required libraries:

üîç How It Works
The system follows a traditional NLP + ML pipeline:

1. Text Preprocessing
Converts text to lowercase.

Removes punctuation, digits, and stopwords using NLTK.

Applies lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.

2. Feature Engineering
Transforms the cleaned text into numerical vectors using:

TfidfVectorizer

or CountVectorizer

Splits data into training and testing sets.

3. Model Training
Trains the model using algorithms like:

Logistic Regression

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine

Saves the trained model for future use via pickle or joblib.

4. Prediction and Evaluation
Predicts whether input text is real or fake.

Evaluation includes:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

üßæ Dataset
The project uses the Fake and Real News Dataset from Kaggle.
